LGA1151 Socket (Coffee Lake Standard)
- Socket must have a BGA.
- Heated to 200-300C
- Whole socket must be replaced as pins for DDR, VCCSA, PEG_R, 
  and VCCGT are damaged
- Capacitors and SMD inductors must be covered during heat up to prevent damage / explosion.
- Kapton tape or anything with thermal insulation properties should be used to cover the parts 
  noted above to prevent future damage. Heatshield should be removed before BGA rework is done. 
- Board warmer is helpful but not needed. 
- BGA solder balls with either be Tin or Lead. Flux, Solder paste, and Hot air may be needed to 
 reball the socket easier.
